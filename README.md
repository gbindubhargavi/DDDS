# 🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection Using OpenCV & Dlib

A real-time driver drowsiness detection system that alerts the driver when signs of drowsiness or sleep are detected using computer vision techniques.

## 🧠 Overview

Fatigue and drowsiness are major causes of road accidents worldwide. This project aims to detect signs of drowsiness using facial landmark detection and eye aspect ratio (EAR) analysis with OpenCV and Dlib. If the driver's eyes remain closed for a certain time threshold, an alarm is triggered to alert the driver.
